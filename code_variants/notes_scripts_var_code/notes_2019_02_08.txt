# aggregate calls into a single VCF (either with joint genotyping or alone)
# joint genotyping: GenotypeGVCFs
# Compare VCF calls (possibly with the GATK tool)
# Annotate with ANNOVAR (and/or other information)
# Find input for PLINK (or something else?) 

# Compare VCF outputs between STAR and HISAT2
# Only consider PASS SNVs (no indels)
# Any other constraints?

# Possible methods are either
# 1) bcftools

https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html#plot-vcfstats
# 2) GATK GenotypeConcordance
